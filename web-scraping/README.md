## Data collection

One of the most important thing in machine learning is you need to have a large amount of training dataset. For most of small company, it's hard for themselves to create such amount of training data (is a good way). So, web scraping is the lowest cost way to collects data. For NLP project, I wrote code to use any two specific words to generate some questions on goolge's 'people also ask'. Then I can annotated the label of each question and put it in to our training database. It's not a long term way to collect data, but it's a really convinient and no cost way to solve some problems.
